HW2 – Task 2: Periodic Backup

• In order to prevent system crash and hard disk broken,
backup is an important task that a system administrator
must do periodically.

• In this task, you are asked to write shell scripts to
periodically back up /home, /var/mail, /etc and
/usr/local/etc. You have to schedule your shell scripts to
run everyday, and keep backup files for 3 days (i.e., you
have to check and delete backup files older than 3 days
after creating a new bunch of backup files).


The details are in the Report_hw2.pdf file.
